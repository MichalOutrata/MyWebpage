								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								
								<p>I am a researcher in numerical linear algebra and connected topics, currently living in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

								<p>
								My interest for mathematics began in my family with my granduncle <a href="http://staff.utia.cas.cz/outrata/">Jiří Outrata</a>  during the secondary school. 
								He introduced me to university-level mathematics and we continued to work together well into my bachelor's years at the Charles University in Prague. 
								However, in later years of my bachelor studies, the influence of the lecturers and professors shifted my main interest to the numerical linear algebra
								and we agreed with <a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~strakos/">Zdeněk Strakoš</a> to work on my Bachelor’s thesis together. 
								At that time I was also offered a position in the research team of <a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~gergelits/">Tomáš Gergelits</a>, which allowed me to attend conferences already as a bachelor student.
								</p>

								<p>
								The summer of 2016 was quite busy as I was awarded the funding to complete a three month summer research internship at the University of Bath and 
								I also had to defend my Bachelor's thesis immediately after returning. Nevertheless, I enjoyed that summer fully and 
								I was entering my Master studies deeply satisfied. I also reaffirmed that I want to work in academia if possible and 
								decided to focus my energy towards my studies to perform above expectations to make myself in this way more attractive for a future PhD supervisor. 
								In addition, I decided to broaden my field of interest by pursuing a new topic in my Master’s thesis under 
								<a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mirektuma/">Miroslav Tůma</a>. 
								I kept my dedication and motivation throughout the studies and I graduated summa cum laude in September 2018. 
								</p>

								<p>
								During the final year of my master‘s studies, I approached <a href="http://www.unige.ch/~gander/">Martin Gander</a> hoping he would have had an open position. 
								I wrote to him in particular because we met in person at the ALGORITHMY 2015 conference during my bachelor studies. 
								It was already back then when I knew I would be extremely lucky to ever get a chance to collaborate with him, based on both academical and personal 
								impression and he kindly offered to lead my PhD studies. Together we applied for the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship to support my stay in Geneva and 
								in 2019 our proposal was awarded the scholarship. I have been thrilled to collaborate with the numerical analysis team of the university and foremost with 
								Martin Gander for the last four years.

								<h3> Krylov methods </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/formulas_transparent.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
								I've worked with and on Krylov methods both in Prague and Geneva. My first topic of interest
								was <em>GMRES and its convergence behavior</em> and eventually became my Bachelor thesis topic, under the supervision of
								<a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~strakos/">Zdeněk Strakoš</a>. The work was an (incomplete) overview of the deep results about GMRES convergence behavior
								and we finished by looking on polynomial methods in general on infinite-dimensional spaces and in what sense 
								we should think about the approximations of the solution and the operators when we discretize and use a Krylov method, e.g., GMRES.

								As a result, I obtained a solid theoretical background in theory and analysis of Krylov methods and GMRES in particular.
								</p>
								<p>
								I continued to be interested in these method and worked on a <em>preconditioner for CG</em> in my Master thesis
								with <a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mirektuma/">Miroslav Tůma</a>. We focused on problems where the system matrix is dually sparse.
								In particular we considered a block matrix with general rectangular block structure such that 
								considerable amount of the blocks are zero and a lot of the non-zero ones are
								data-sparse (i.e., either low-rank or well-approximable by some hierarchical format).

								As a result, I learned techniques to deal both with structurally sparse matrices (elimination tree, graph prunning, ...)  
								as well as with the data-sparse ones, e.g., hierarchical formats (such as HODLR, H, ...() but also low-rank approximation techniques
								(CUR approximation, randomized techniques, ...).

								<h3> Domain decomposition methods methods </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ddm1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
								During my PhD I've transitioned to domain decomposition methods and the <em>Schwarz methods</em> in particular, navigated by 
								<a href="http://www.unige.ch/~gander/index.php">Martin Gander</a>.
								We started with <em>optimized Schwarz methods withdata-sparse transmission conditions</em> as a natural progression given my Master's background. 
								This topic turned out to be very challenging to analyze, especially in contrast to structurally sparse transmission conditions. However the 
								numerical results are very promising for the standard model problems. This naturally lead to further study of convergence behavior and 
								<em>convergence bounds</em> in particular for the algebraic formulations of Schwarz methods.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/RelTop.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>
								With <a href="http://www.unige.ch/~gander/index.php">Martin Gander</a> we have looked at the newly proposed block GMRES preconditioner
								for systems coming out of implicit Runge-Kutta discretizations of paraboplic PDEs - originaly the work of 
								<a href="https://www.math.ttu.edu/~vhowle/">Victoria Howle</a> and her group. We tried to understand why does it work 
								so tremendously well for most problems and obtained some interesting results.
								</p>

								<p>
								With <a href="http://www.unige.ch/~gander/index.php">Martin Gander</a> and 
								<a href="https://www.mechlabgabriellame.fr/annuaire/?id=311">Lukáš Jakabčin</a> we worked on Schur complement approximation qualities,
								focusing on the Schur complement on a truncated mesh and its relation to the Schur complement on unbounded domain.
								</p>

								<p>
								Me and my granduncle <a href="http://staff.utia.cas.cz/outrata/">Jiří Outrata</a> have done some research in set-valued convex optimization
								but I deviated from this line of research already during my bachelor studies in Prague.

								Most of my teaching experience has been truly positive and pleasant as I enjoy interacting
								with younger students. Most of the times I was in charge (not necessarily solely) of preparing and presenting
								the exercises (often heavily inspired by previous runs of the course) and/or correcting these and giving feedback to students.

								<h2 class="major">More about me</h2>

								<section>
									<p>
										The goal of this page is for you (be it a student or a (potential) collaborator) to get
										some insight into what I am like outside the academia. If we meet at lunch (or elsewhere),
										we could talk about dozen of things completely unrelated to anything written below but maybe
										these can serve as humble suggestions.

										<br>

										Currently I'm living with my wife Lea and our cat Čičík in Geneva.
										In my free time I like to do sport activities, I climb and boulder regularly
										in <a href="https://planetclimbing.ch/en/">Planet Climbing</a> and also bike a decent amount. 
										I used to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floorball">florbal</a> as 
										a goalie back in highschool but also did some handball, baseball, basketball and (beach) volleyball.

										<br>

										I enjoy following cultural and political issues and more general discussions about learning,
										thinking and mind, in all of which I have found the podcaster and philosopher <a href="https://www.samharris.org/">Sam Harris</a>
										extremely helpful and influential.

										<br>

										From tme to time I relax playing games - either with Lea, our friends or on my own. Our/my favourite titles include
										Terra Mystica, Puerto Rico, Wingspan, Dominion, Magic The Gathering, Code Names and Dixit but also
										Stellaris, It Takes Two, League of Legends or Diablo 2. Me and Lea also like to read and watch together -
										we enjoyed the Eragon and also the Wool sagas but we also spent hours watching The Office or Red Dwarf series
										or listening to the audiobooks of Terry Prachett.
